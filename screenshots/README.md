## Screenshot Generation

Screenshots are automatically generated when possible. If you need to manually generate screenshots:

1. Use a tool like [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) or [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)
2. Navigate to the live site
3. Take screenshots at different viewport sizes
4. Save as PNG files in this directory

## Future Enhancement

The GitHub Action workflow can be extended to automatically generate screenshots using a headless browser.
